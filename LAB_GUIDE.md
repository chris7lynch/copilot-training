## Lab 1: Security Vulnerability Fix (Basic Chat Usage)

**Focus**: Learning to use Copilot Chat for code analysis and fixes

### Objective
Use GitHub Copilot Chat to identify and fix a SQL injection vulnerability, demonstrating how AI can help with security code reviews.

**üìñ Background Reading**: For detailed information about SQL injection vulnerabilities, see `vulnerabilities/sql_injection/SQL_Injection_Lab.md`

### Step 1: Explore the Vulnerability
1. Open your browser and test these URLs:
   - Normal: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/vulnerable/users/admin`
   - Malicious: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/vulnerable/users/admin%27%20OR%20%271%27%3D%271`
   - Compare: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/vulnerable/users` (see all users)

2. **Understanding the Attack**: The malicious URL contains `admin' OR '1'='1` (URL-encoded above). This manipulates the SQL query from:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'
   ```
   Into:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR '1'='1'
   ```
   Since `'1'='1'` is always true, the query returns all users instead of just "admin", bypassing the intended access control.

3. Notice how the malicious URL returns all users instead of just "admin"

### Step 2: Use Copilot to Identify the Issue
1. Open `vulnerabilities/sql_injection/vulnerable_routes.py`
2. Find the `get_user_by_username_vulnerable()` function
3. Select the function and open Copilot Chat:
   - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Ctrl+I`
   - **Mac**: `‚åÉ‚áßI` (Control+Shift+I) or `‚åòI` (Command+I)
4. Ask Copilot:
   ```
   Review the get_user_by_username_vulnerable function for security vulnerabilities. What's wrong with this SQL query construction?
   ```

### Step 3: Generate the Fix
1. Select the entire vulnerable function
2. In Copilot Chat, use this command:
   ```
   Fix this function to prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries. Keep the same route and behavior, only fix the security issues. Add input validation (check for empty/null usernames and reasonable length limits). Use secure error handling that doesn't expose database details to users.
   ```
3. Review the suggested changes and apply them

### Step 4: Verify the Fix
1. Save the file and restart the server if needed
2. Test the malicious URL again: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/vulnerable/users/admin%27%20OR%20%271%27%3D%271`
3. **Success looks like**: The endpoint now returns a http error or validation error instead of exposing all users

### üéì Key Takeaways
- Copilot can identify common security vulnerabilities
- Specific, detailed prompts yield better results
- Always verify and understand AI-generated fixes
- Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection

**üìñ Detailed Guide**: See `vulnerabilities/sql_injection/SQL_Injection_Lab.md` for complete documentation.

### Objective
Execute a pre-built prompt file to transform the entire application to dark mode, demonstrating how prompt files can orchestrate large-scale changes.

### Step 1: Examine the Current UI
1. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser
2. Note the current light theme styling
3. Take a screenshot or mental note for comparison

### Step 2: Review the Prompt File
1. Open `.github/prompts/dark-mode.prompt.md`
2. Review the YAML front matter:
   - `mode: agent`
   - `model: Claude Sonnet 4`
   - `description: Enhance the FastAPI training app with an accessible dark theme`
3. Read through the mission and objectives

### Step 3: Execute the Prompt File
1. With `dark-mode.prompt.md` open in VS Code
2. Open the Command Palette:
   - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   - **Mac**: `‚áß‚åòP` (Shift+Command+P)
3. Run the command: "Run Prompt"
4. Wait for Copilot to analyze and modify the files
5. Review the changes in:
   - `app/static/style.css`
   - `app/templates/index.html` (if modified)
   - `app/static/script.js` (if modified)

### Step 4: See the Results
1. Refresh `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
2. **Success looks like**: The website now has a dark theme with good contrast and readable text
3. Test interactive elements (buttons, hover states)
4. Verify accessibility (keyboard navigation, contrast)

### üéì Key Takeaways
- Prompt files enable complex, multi-file changes
- YAML front matter provides structure and constraints
- Agent mode allows autonomous file modification
- Good prompts include specific objectives and constraints
